  meeting_point: "Federation Square steps"
  end_point: "Gelato / dessert"
  players: [Tom, Mon]

  equipment: [charged phones, small cash/card, myki, pen]
  tie_breaker_order: [most_targets_total, earliest_last_target_time]
  notes: "No winner bonuses. Just count targets you personally achieve. If both achieve a target, both score it. Bragging rights decided by speed only where stated."

scoring:
  points_per_target: 1
  total_targets: 32   # Updated sum after enumeration (verify if later edits change)

# Ordered route rationale (v3.4 – per-target scoring, diversified geek venues, coop reset points):
# 1-2 Warm-up movement & visual scanning.
# 3 Palate + sensory break (coffee ritual).
# 4 Quiet architectural pivot.
# 5 Geek anchor (broad franchise density) before splitting venues.
# 6 Wearable specificity at Moko Select (variety).
# 7 Trio taxonomy puzzle at Critical Hit.
# 8 Literary shift (books/manga cross-genre).
# 9 Transit motion capture micro-target.
# 10 Intentional chill rule (cooperative reset).
# 11 Genre definition micro-justification (Metroidvania).
# 12 Humorous adult oddity (respectful, brief).
# 13 Vertical contrast visual framing.
# 14 Sweet cooperative closure.
